		  <h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Of the countless transactions available in the Internet space, the website that I will design and create is the ticket exchange website. Many ticket-trading websites can be found on the Internet now, such as bizzabo, seatedly, etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the past, ticketing, which was only available on-site, has become available on the Internet since the early 2000s. Since then, online ticket issuance has been increasing over the years.

			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>Before, I talk about ticketing website, it is really important to talk about 'Elements that can make a business website successful'. According to <em>Allison Bowlus</em>, few factors makes small business website successfully. 
      <br><br>
      Which is;
      <ul>
        <li>Obtain a good domain name</li>
        <li>Make home page (landing page) a to-the-point summary</li>
        <li>Keep forms simple</li>
        <li>Make it easy for visitors to contact you</li>
        <li>Regularly create and publish quality content</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      After I found out the factors, I realized that when creating a website, I should make it as simple and easy to use as possible.

      USYD student who loves hip-hop. He found out that Kanye will perform in Sydney, so he is really excited and delighted.

      USYD student who loves k-pop. She loves BTS very much, and she is planning to see a BTS performance in New Zealand. For her,  the price of the ticket doesn't really matter. She would prefer a website provides the largest number of tickets.

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>As I mentioned on research, the website should be easy and simple to use. It would be good for users to use the website that only has simple necessary information, rather than having useless information.
      <br><br>
      Because everything people ask for is different, website needs to be able to meet as many things as possible, and because there are many users who like cheap prices, website will put a subscription function within the website itself to carry out events or ticket promotions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Overall, the elements needed for the website</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Easy and simple to use</li>
				<li>Subscription function</li>
				<li>Sell various tickets, such as concert ticket, meuseam tickets, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
      	<figure>
				<img src="Pic/MoodBoard.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>This is mood board that I create.</figcaption>
      </figure>
			<p>Inside the Mood Board, there is a picture of Easy and Simple, which is the two words that I consider most important when designing a website.
      <br><br>
      By using the ticketing website, users can visit various concerts, art galleries and museums, which will be sold at the lowest prices and various promotional events.
      <br><br>
      The representative colors of the ticketing brand are blue. Dark blue and light blue are the main two colors.</p>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>Here is the sketches of wireframe of website.</p>

		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>Depending on how I make the design of website, the number of users can increase or decrease. Therefore, I think it is most important to use a design that is as conspicuous and convincing as possible. An easy and simple-to-use design will be the best design.</p>

			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>Wireframes of landing page, sign up page and end page.</p>
      <br>
			<!-- Use the figure element for embedding images and iframes with annotations/captions -->
      <p>Basically, Brand logo is located on top left corner. Sign up and Log in button located on top right corner. On the middle of homepage, there are breif information about ticketing website and subsribe membership.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="Pic/Landing.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>This is wireframe of landing page.</figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p>On Sign up page, only information fields related to sign up will be centrally located.</p>

      <figure>
				<img src="Pic/Signup.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>This is wireframe of sign up page.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>On the End page, Welcome message and information about membership will be located. The subscription recommendation section will show what benefits and adventages a subscription has.</p>

      <figure>
				<img src="Pic/Endpage.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>This is wireframe of end page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <figure>
				<img src="Pic/MockLP.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>This is mockup of landing page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				<img src="Pic/MockSU.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>This is mockup of sign up page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				<img src="Pic/MockEG.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
        <figcaption>This is mockup of end page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Blue was designated as the representative color of the website, and the design was made as simple as possible. The explanations, photos, and information on the web page are intended to think more and put more information before the final assignment.</p>
