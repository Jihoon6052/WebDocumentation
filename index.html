			<h2>About my proposal</h2>
			<p>First, here is the link to my <a href="Proposal.html">Web Proposal</a>. Due to the lack of idea about the website, I was not able to make cool website proposal. However, I decided to do my best to make a website.
      </br> </br>
      As I am a beginner of coding languages such as html and css, I thought it was impossible to make a website like an expert. Therefore, I would create a website that can be created using as simple code as possible. Based on what I learned in class, I wanted to use the knowledge that I learned as much as possible and create a website that looked as neat as possible.
      </br> </br>
      After a lot of trial and error, I created a website. Even though I finished it, it still has lots of mistakes and errors. Based on this project, I want to learn more about html and css, and I hope someday I can make perfect and neat website.
      </p>

			<h2>Iteration</h2>
			<p>As in the <a href="Proposal.html#mockups">proposal</a>,I used same Ticket Fly logo. Also, the basic color is similar to the blue. In addition, the location of information and other characteristics have changed more and more through several iterations. 
      </br></br>
      There have been many iterations, but I will explain them in as short two iterations as possible.
      </p>
			<h3 id="moodboards">First iteration</h3>
			<p>At first, the website was almost identical to the proposal. There was no difference, such as the position of the button or the position of the text box. It was a clean but very monotonous website, including the color of the background and button. So, I decided to change the background color using gradient. 
        <figure>
          <img src="Pic/It1.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
          <figcaption>This is landing page after first iteration.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      However, changing the background color caused a clash between colors on the website. So, I need to think more about the harmony of colors and buttons. 
      </p>
			<h3 id="sketches">Second iteration</h3>
			<p>
        As a result of thinking about harmony and combining various coding, the current website was created.
          <figure>
          <img src="Pic/LP.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
          <figcaption>This is landing page after second iteration.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="Pic/SP.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
          <figcaption>This is signup page after second iteration.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="Pic/EP.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
          <figcaption>This is end page after second iteration.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Once the overall color has been changed. Adjustments were made to avoid overlapping with the background colors. Also, instead of putting a button in the header section, we made it easier by using nav, ol, and li code. Several coding operations have also been carried out, and basically, the headers are applied reactively. If it goes below a certain px, the header changes in this way.
        <figure>
          <img src="Pic/R.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
          <figcaption>This shows how my reactive webpage works.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Also, I add few more extra code in this webpage, which is this;
        <figure>
          <img src="Pic/A.png" alt="placeholder image"/>
          <figcaption>When the cursor is up, short animation appears.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        On the end page, a code has been created to inform people who want to join a membership and those who want to know the benefits, along with animations when they place the cursor on the image.
      </p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>I created responsive web pages, but they are not in a perfect state. Some of my coding didn't respond reactively, so I left it there for now. Still, it is fortunate that the headers, image files and texts are responding. While doing this assessment, I went through many trials and errors. In the meantime, I learned once more that I was still a beginner in coding and designing. I got passion to study harder on code and design through this assessment. 
      </br></br>
      Also, compared to the web profile, it has changed a lot, but I think it is fortunate that it was made in a similar direction. Based on this experience, it was fun to learn how to make web protocols and the approximate process of creating web pages.
